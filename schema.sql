1 Lime
1 Orange
2 Tbsps Butter
4 Boneless, Skinless Chicken Breasts
1 Tbsp Ancho Chile Paste
2 Tbsps Crème Fraîche

2. Prepare the ingredients & make the glaze: While the rice cooks, wash and dry the fresh produce. Peel the carrots; quarter lengthwise, then halve crosswise. Peel and roughly chop the garlic. Remove and discard the stems of the kale; finely chop the leaves. Using a peeler, remove the lime rind, avoiding the white pith; mince to get 2 teaspoons of zest (or use a zester). Halve the lime crosswise. Halve the orange; squeeze the juice into a bowl, straining out any seeds. Whisk in the chile paste and 2 tablespoons of water until smooth.
3. Roast the carrots: Place the sliced carrots on a sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Arrange in an even layer. Roast 15 to 17 minutes, or until tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.

Add the chopped garlic and cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until fragrant. Add the chopped kale; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until slightly wilted. Add 1/3 cup of water; season with salt and pepper.

In the same pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned chicken and cook 4 to 6 minutes on the first side, or until browned. Flip and cook 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add the glaze and cook, frequently spooning the glaze over the chicken, 2 to 3 minutes, or until the chicken is coated and cooked through. Turn off the heat; stir the butter and the juice of 1 lime half into the glaze until the butter has melted. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
